Go Package Store
================

Update your Go packages with style.

This package is still under development, but you can try it right now:

```bash
go get -u -d github.com/shurcooL/Go-Package-Store
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/shurcooL/Go-Package-Store
go run main.go godep.go
```

When finished, it will be more convenient to use (a self-contained binary). Open an issue if you find one.
